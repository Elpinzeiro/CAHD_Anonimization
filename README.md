# CAHD_Anonimization
Implementation of CAHD algorithm for transaction data anonymization

Starting from the paper _On the Anonymization of Sparse High-Dimensional Data_ this code wants to show a possible implementation using the **Python** programming language.

## Main.py
Input params:
*p param 
*QID subset
*SD subset
*dataset path

After parsing the input file, and checking the validity of the inputs the anonymization takes place. Finally the KL-Divergence and computed time values are printed and the two matrices shown.
